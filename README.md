This app allows Lukso users to securely communicate with each other through a chat interface. All messages are encrypted using end-to-end encryption, which means that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.

To use the app, users must first create a Lukso profile and log in. Once logged in, they can search for other Lukso users and start a chat with them.

The app uses the Signal inspired protocol for end-to-end encryption, which is a widely-used and trusted encryption protocol. The app also uses strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.

This app is intended for use by Lukso users who value privacy and security in their communications.
